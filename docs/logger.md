# Logger
This template has a logger file that is recommended to be used rather than the regular `console.log` function;
It formats the messages depending on the log type, whether its `log`, `info`, `error` and `warn`.

Also it offers a useful `command` function where it takes a `CommandInteraction` and logs a command usage including its name and the user with the username and ID.

### Usage
Simply import `logger.js` file wherever you need it. Make sure that you properly import it by importing it with relative path.
